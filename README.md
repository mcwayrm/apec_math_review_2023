# Applied Economics Math Review Course
# University of Minnesota

## Description

This is a repository on the course material for the graduate-level mathematics required by the Applied Economics program at the University of Minnesota. 
This material is targeted towards incoming masters and doctoral students for the Fall of 2023. 

The structure and details of this three week course can be found on the syllabus PDF. 

Lecture slides will be updated and made avaliable before classes for download by students. Please note the timestamp for documents on Github to determine if material is up to date. 
Problem sets will be assigned, although they will be optional. I will provide a solution set the following day, uploaded to Github. They are designed for you to determine where you are struggling. 
Let me know where you struggled so we can improve on those areas. 

## Miscellanous 

This course has been taught for several years. I rely heavily upon consultation with previous instructors and their course material. 
If you are dis-satisfied with my presentation of the material, feel free to reference their course material which I have made avaliable through this repository. 

Finally, if you do not have a Github account I would strongly recommend:
1. Creating one for both publicly signalling and personal organization, and
2. Adapting your research workflow to utilize Git and Github.

While I am not the Coding camp instructor, I have experience working in R, Stata, and Python. I use Git and Github in my regular workflow. If you want assistance on coding outside that course, please reach out directly.
